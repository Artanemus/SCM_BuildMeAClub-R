# BuildMeAClub SQL Scripts

SQL Scripts generated by ERStudio are now held in the ERStudio repository. This makes it easier to deal with version control. This repository isn't public.

If you need the build script for the SwimClubMeet MS SQLEXPRESS database. Install the SCM_BuildMeAClub application. (Selecting the preferred version.) Then navigate to `C:\Program Files\Artanemus\BuildMeAClub\SQL\`. Here you will find the script(s).
