# BuildMeAClub SQL Scripts

SQL Scripts, generated by ERStudio, are now held in the ERStudio repository. This makes it a little easier to deal with version control. This repository isn't public.

If you need the build script for the SwimClubMeet MS SQLEXPRESS database.

- Install the SCM_BuildMeAClub application.
- After installation, navigate to `#PROGRAMFILES#\Artanemus\BuildMeAClub\BMAC_SCRIPTS\`. Here you will find all the build versions.
